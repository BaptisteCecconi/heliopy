pycdf
-----

The entirity of pycdf in this directory has been forked without change from the
[spacepy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spacepy/) project. However, this is
a minimal-dependency version which should be much easier to install compared to
the full spacepy distribution. To use pycdf after installying heliopy do

```python
from pycdf import pycdf
```

All the documentation for pycdf can be found at https://pythonhosted.org/SpacePy/pycdf.html

spacepy (and therefore all the code in this directory) is licensed under the
[Python Software Foundation license](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html).
