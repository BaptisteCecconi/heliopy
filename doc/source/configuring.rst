Configuring heliopy
===================

heliopy comes with a sample 'heliopyrc' file. In order to customise the file
make a copy of it at ``~/.heliopy/heliopyrc`` and edit that copy.
The default contents of the file are:

.. literalinclude:: ../../heliopy/heliopyrc

.. only:: builder_html

   A copy can be downloaded :download:`here <../../heliopy/heliopyrc>`
