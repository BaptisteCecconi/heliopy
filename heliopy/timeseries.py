def removespikes(v, threshold):
    """
    Replace spikes in data with nans.

    Spikes are indentified as follows:
    * The discrete second derivative is calculated at each point.
    * The standard deviation of all the second derivatives is taken (std).
    * All points whose second derivative magnitude is greater than threshold *
    std are replace with nans.

    Parameters
    ----------
        v : array_like
            Data to remove spikes from.
        threshold : float
            Treshold to determine size of spikes to remove.

    Returns
    -------
        out : array_like
            De-spiked data.
