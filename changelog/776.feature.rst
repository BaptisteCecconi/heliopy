:class:`heliopy.spice.Trajectory` objects now have the
:attr:`~heliopy.spice.Trajectory.coords` property, that contains the trajectory
coordinates as an `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` object.

In order to do this
currently only the 'J2000' and 'IAU_SUN' spice frames are supported as they
have direct mappings to Sunpy/Astropy coordinate systems, but it is possible
to generate coordinates in either of these systems and then transform them
post-hoc to another Sunpy/Astropy coordinate system.
