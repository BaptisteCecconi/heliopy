A handful of data download functions have migrated to using the CDAS restful
service, and have therefore had their call signatures changed. In particular
the following functions have lost their ``try_download`` keyword argument:
  - :func:`heliopy.data.ace.swics_heavy_ions`
  - :func:`heliopy.data.ace.swics_abundances`
  - :func:`heliopy.data.ulysses.fgm_hires` (748)
  - :func:`heliopy.data.ulysses.swoops_ions` (761)
  - :func:`heliopy.data.omni.low` (765)
  - `heliopy.data.imp.merged` (771)
